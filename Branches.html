            <h2>Branches</h2>
            <p>Science is broadly divided into three major branches: Physical Science, Life Science, and Earth Science. Each branch encompasses various fields of study that explore different aspects of the natural world.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Physical Science</h2>
            <p>The physical branches of science mainly deal with the study of non-living systems, matter, energy, and the laws of nature. They help us understand the physical world, from the smallest particles to the largest structures in the universe.</p>

            <h2>Life Science</h2>
            <p>Life Science is the branch of science that studies living things and their life processes. It deals with organisms such as plants, animals, and microorganisms, and explores how they live, grow, reproduce, and interact with their environment. Life science helps us understand the natural world and improves human life through medicine, agriculture, and environmental conservation.</p>
